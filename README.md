Daily Telegram Info Bot
About

This project is a Python-based Telegram bot that automatically sends daily updates at 9:00 AM. The bot provides users with current weather information and up-to-date currency exchange rates directly to a specified chat. It demonstrates how to use the Telegram Bot API, retrieve real-time data from the web, and schedule tasks in Python.

The bot can be customized by setting your Telegram bot token, chat ID, and preferred location and currencies. Once the script is running, it will automatically send the daily updates without any further input from the user. This project is useful for anyone who wants a simple automated way to stay informed about weather and financial information.
